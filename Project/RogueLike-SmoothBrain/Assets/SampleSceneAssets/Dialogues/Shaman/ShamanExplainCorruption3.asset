  dialogue: "Each time you get corruption, from quests or fountains, your progress
    bar will increase and reach tiers. Thus, these will impact your body. Each tier,
    you\u2019ll become very strong, gaining some strength against monsters and healing
    each time you kill one of \u2018em, but you\u2019ll need to sacrifice some of
    your life and defense. No worries, you\u2019ll be so strong you don\u2019t need
    that hehe!"
