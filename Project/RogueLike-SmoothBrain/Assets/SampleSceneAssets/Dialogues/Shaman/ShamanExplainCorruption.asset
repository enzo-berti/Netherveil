  dialogue: 'Haha, it''s simple ! Corruption is a statistic that gives you different
    buffs & nerfs based on your current corruption stage : each stage of corruption
    between 25% and 75% gives you ATK but makes you lose HP, and if you manage to
    go to 100%, you will get a new special ability that will permit you to destroy
    your enemies and an extra lifesteal to make you sustain, but as a counterpart
    you will not be able to heal from consumables.. But be careful ! If you join
    the corruption path after you tried the benediction one, you will have to defile
    yourself first before grinding corruption stages!'
