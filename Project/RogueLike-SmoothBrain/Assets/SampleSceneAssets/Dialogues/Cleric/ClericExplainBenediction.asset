  dialogue: 'Haha, it''s simple ! Benediction is a statistic that gives you different
    buffs & nerfs based on your current benediction stage : each stage of benediction
    between 25% and 75% gives you HP but make you lose ATK, and if you manage to
    go to 100%, you will get a new special ability that will make you invincible
    for a few seconds, but as a counterpart you will have a small chance on each
    enemy to duplicate themselves when entering a room.. But be careful ! If you
    join the benediction path after you tried the corruption one, you will have to
    purify yourself first before grinding benediction stages!'
